## What is Mercedes-Benz?

<!-- <a href="https://labelstud.io/blog/release-130.html"><img src="https://github.com/Mercedes-Benz/label-studio/raw/master/docs/themes/htx/source/images/release-130/LS-Hits-v1.3.png" align="right" /></a> -->

Mercedes-Benz is an open source data labeling tool. It lets you label data types like audio, text, images, videos, and time series with a simple and straightforward UI and export to various model formats. It can be used to prepare raw data or improve existing training data to get more accurate ML models.

Have a custom dataset? You can customize Mercedes-Benz to fit your needs. Read an [introductory blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-label-studio-a-swiss-army-knife-of-data-labeling-140c1be92881) to learn more. 

## Try out Mercedes-Benz

Install Mercedes-Benz locally or deploy it in a cloud instance. [Or sign up for a free trial of our Starter Cloud edition!](https://mercedes-benz.com/platform/starter-cloud/) You can learn more about what each edition offers [here](https://labelstud.io/guide/label_studio_compare). 

- [Install locally with Docker](#install-locally-with-docker)
- [Run with Docker Compose (Mercedes-Benz + Nginx + PostgreSQL)](#run-with-docker-compose)
- [Install locally with pip](#install-locally-with-pip)
- [Install locally with poetry](#install-locally-with-poetry)
- [Install locally with Anaconda](#install-locally-with-anaconda)
- [Install for local development](#install-for-local-development)
- [Deploy in a cloud instance](#deploy-in-a-cloud-instance)

### Install locally with Docker
Official Mercedes-Benz docker image is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/heartexlabs/label-studio) and it can be downloaded with `docker pull`. 
Run Mercedes-Benz in a Docker container and access it at `http://localhost:8080`.


```bash
docker pull heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
```
You can find all the generated assets, including SQLite3 database storage `label_studio.sqlite3` and uploaded files, in the `./mydata` directory.

#### Override default Docker install
You can override the default launch command by appending the new arguments:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio --log-level DEBUG
```

#### Build a local image with Docker
If you want to build a local image, run:
```bash
docker build -t heartexlabs/label-studio:latest .
```

### Run with Docker Compose
Docker Compose script provides production-ready stack consisting of the following components:

- Mercedes-Benz
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - proxy web server used to load various static data, including uploaded audio, images, etc.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - production-ready database that replaces less performant SQLite3.

To start using the app from `http://localhost` run this command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Run with Docker Compose + MinIO
You can also run it with an additional MinIO server for local S3 storage. This is particularly useful when you want to 
test the behavior with S3 storage on your local system. To start Mercedes-Benz in this way, you need to run the following command:
````bash
# Add sudo on Linux if you are not a member of the docker group
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.minio.yml up -d
````
If you do not have a static IP address, you must create an entry in your hosts file so that both Mercedes-Benz and your 
browser can access the MinIO server. For more detailed instructions, please refer to [our guide on storing data](docs/source/guide/storedata.md).


### Install locally with pip

```bash
# Requires Python >=3.10
pip install label-studio

# Start the server at http://localhost:8080
label-studio
```

### Install locally with poetry

```bash
### install poetry
pip install poetry

### set poetry environment
poetry new my-label-studio
cd my-label-studio
poetry add label-studio

### activate poetry environment
poetry shell

### Start the server at http://localhost:8080
label-studio
```

### Install locally with Anaconda

```bash
conda create --name label-studio
conda activate label-studio
conda install psycopg2
pip install label-studio
```

### Install for local development

You can run the latest Mercedes-Benz version locally without installing the package from pypi. 

```bash
# Install all package dependencies
pip install poetry
poetry install
# Run database migrations
python label_studio/manage.py migrate
python label_studio/manage.py collectstatic
# Start the server in development mode at http://localhost:8080
python label_studio/manage.py runserver
```

### Deploy in a cloud instance

You can deploy Mercedes-Benz with one click in Heroku, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform: 

<a href="https://www.heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Mercedes-Benz/label-studio/tree/heroku-persistent-pg"><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy" height="30px"></a>
[<img src="https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton" height="30px">](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmercedes-benz%2Flabel-studio%2Fdevelop%2Fazuredeploy.json)
[<img src="https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg" height="30px">](https://deploy.cloud.run)


#### Apply frontend changes

For information about updating the frontend, see [label-studio/web/README.md](https://github.com/Mercedes-Benz/label-studio/blob/develop/web/README.md#installation-instructions).


#### Install dependencies on Windows 
To run Mercedes-Benz on Windows, download and install the following wheel packages from [Gohlke builds](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) to ensure you're using the correct version of Python:
- [lxml](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml)

```bash
# Upgrade pip 
pip install -U pip

# If you're running Win64 with Python 3.8, install the packages downloaded from Gohlke:
pip install lxml‑4.5.0‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl

# Install label studio
pip install label-studio
```

### Run test suite
To add the tests' dependencies to your local install:

```bash
poetry install --with test
```

Alternatively, it is possible to run the unit tests from a Docker container in which the test dependencies are installed:


```bash
make build-testing-image
make docker-testing-shell
```

In either case, to run the unit tests:

```bash
cd label_studio

# sqlite3
DJANGO_DB=sqlite DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio pytest -vv

# postgres (assumes default postgres user,db,pass. Will not work in Docker
# testing container without additional configuration)
DJANGO_DB=default DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio pytest -vv
```
 
## What you get from Mercedes-Benz

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/525ad5ff-6904-4398-b507-7e8954268d69

- **Multi-user labeling** sign up and login, when you create an annotation it's tied to your account.
- **Multiple projects** to work on all your datasets in one instance.
- **Streamlined design** helps you focus on your task, not how to use the software.
- **Configurable label formats** let you customize the visual interface to meet your specific labeling needs.
- **Support for multiple data types** including images, audio, text, HTML, time-series, and video. 
- **Import from files or from cloud storage** in Amazon AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or JSON, CSV, TSV, RAR, and ZIP archives. 
- **Integration with machine learning models** so that you can visualize and compare predictions from different models and perform pre-labeling.
- **Embed it in your data pipeline** REST API makes it easy to make it a part of your pipeline

## Included templates for labeling data in Mercedes-Benz 

Mercedes-Benz includes a variety of templates to help you label your data, or you can create your own using specifically designed configuration language. The most common templates and use cases for labeling include the following cases:

<img src="/images/template-types.png" />

## Set up machine learning models with Mercedes-Benz

Connect your favorite machine learning model using the Mercedes-Benz Machine Learning SDK. Follow these steps:

1. Start your own machine learning backend server. See [more detailed instructions](https://github.com/Mercedes-Benz/label-studio-ml-backend).
2. Connect Mercedes-Benz to the server on the model page found in project settings.

This lets you:

- **Pre-label** your data using model predictions. 
- Do **online learning** and retrain your model while new annotations are being created. 
- Do **active learning** by labeling only the most complex examples in your data.

## Integrate Mercedes-Benz with your existing tools

You can use Mercedes-Benz as an independent part of your machine learning workflow or integrate the frontend or backend into your existing tools.
